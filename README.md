# two_barrels_sample_client_server
 various client/server architecture samples

Here is a collection of networking projects exploring different networking protocols. I have included a tcp client, coded in C, as well as a multi-threaded http server, an mqtt client, a peer-to-peer server architecture, and a client using transport layer security for cryptographic authentication, all coded in Python. Many of these projects utilize other files, but I have only included my own work.
